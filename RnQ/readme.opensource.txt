=== ABOUT OPEN SOURCE, by Massimo Melina aka rejetto

I believe "open source" is the way to get a better technology.
Nowadays I'm releasing most software i make as open source.
This was not true when I started working on &RQ.
At last I decided to publish these sources because it is something
important for most &RQ users, even though most of them don't know it.

Don't complain with me about the low quality.
I know most code in it sucks, i'm just sorry.
I delayed the release for 2 years because of it.
I don't have time/desire to rewrite it from scratch.
But you are now _free_ to do it yourself, if you wish to.
